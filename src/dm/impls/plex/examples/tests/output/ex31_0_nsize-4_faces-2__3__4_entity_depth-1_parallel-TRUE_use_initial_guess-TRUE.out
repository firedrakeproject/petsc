Attempt rebalancing of shared points of depth 1 on interface of mesh distribution.
Size of generated auxiliary graph: 49
Using ParMETIS to partition graph.
Using current distribution of points as initial guess.
Comparing number of owned entities of depth 1 on each process before rebalancing, after rebalancing, and after consistency checks.
Initial.     Min: 22, Max: 46, Ratio: 2.090909
Rebalanced.  Min: 27, Max: 39, Ratio: 1.444444
After.      Min: 27, Max: 39, Ratio: 1.444444
