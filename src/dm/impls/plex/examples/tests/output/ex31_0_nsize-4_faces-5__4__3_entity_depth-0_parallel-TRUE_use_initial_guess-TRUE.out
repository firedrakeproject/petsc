Attempt rebalancing of shared points of depth 0 on interface of mesh distribution.
Size of generated auxiliary graph: 54
Using ParMETIS to partition graph.
Using current distribution of points as initial guess.
Comparing number of owned entities of depth 0 on each process before rebalancing, after rebalancing, and after consistency checks.
Initial.     Min: 14, Max: 44, Ratio: 3.142857
Rebalanced.  Min: 23, Max: 37, Ratio: 1.608696
After.      Min: 23, Max: 37, Ratio: 1.608696
