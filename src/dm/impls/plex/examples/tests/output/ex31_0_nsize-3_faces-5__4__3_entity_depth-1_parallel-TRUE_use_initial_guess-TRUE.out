Attempt rebalancing of shared points of depth 1 on interface of mesh distribution.
Size of generated auxiliary graph: 67
Using ParMETIS to partition graph.
Using current distribution of points as initial guess.
Comparing number of owned entities of depth 1 on each process before rebalancing, after rebalancing, and after consistency checks.
Initial.     Min: 81, Max: 117, Ratio: 1.444444
Rebalanced.  Min: 89, Max: 102, Ratio: 1.146067
After.      Min: 89, Max: 102, Ratio: 1.146067
