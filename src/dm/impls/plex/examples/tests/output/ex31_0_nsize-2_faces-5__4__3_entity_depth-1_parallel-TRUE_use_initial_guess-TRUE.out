Attempt rebalancing of shared points of depth 1 on interface of mesh distribution.
Size of generated auxiliary graph: 40
Using ParMETIS to partition graph.
Using current distribution of points as initial guess.
Comparing number of owned entities of depth 1 on each process before rebalancing, after rebalancing, and after consistency checks.
Initial.     Min: 124, Max: 162, Ratio: 1.306452
Rebalanced.  Min: 142, Max: 144, Ratio: 1.014085
After.      Min: 142, Max: 144, Ratio: 1.014085
