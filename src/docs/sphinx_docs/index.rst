.. Important::

  The PETSc docs are currently in transition,
  and different pieces "live" in two different places. In addition to on this page,
  much of the documentation is found `here <https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/documentation/index.html>`__.

PETSc, pronounced PET-see (`/ˈpɛt-siː/ <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English#Key>`__), is a suite of
data structures and routines for the scalable (parallel) solution of scientific
applications modeled by partial differential equations. It supports MPI, and GPUs through
CUDA or OpenCL, as well as hybrid MPI-GPU parallelism. PETSc (sometimes called PETSc/Tao)
also contains the Tao optimization software library.

PETSc is developed as :ref:`open-source <doc_license>`, requests and contributions are welcome.
