Attempt rebalancing of shared points of depth 1 on interface of mesh distribution.
Size of generated auxiliary graph: 35
Using ParMETIS to partition graph.
Using current distribution of points as initial guess.
Comparing number of owned entities of depth 1 on each process before rebalancing, after rebalancing, and after consistency checks.
Initial.     Min: 37, Max: 54, Ratio: 1.459459
Rebalanced.  Min: 42, Max: 47, Ratio: 1.119048
After.      Min: 42, Max: 47, Ratio: 1.119048
