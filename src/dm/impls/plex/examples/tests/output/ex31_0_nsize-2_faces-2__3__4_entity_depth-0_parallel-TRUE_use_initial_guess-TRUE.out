Attempt rebalancing of shared points of depth 0 on interface of mesh distribution.
Size of generated auxiliary graph: 14
Using ParMETIS to partition graph.
Using current distribution of points as initial guess.
Comparing number of owned entities of depth 0 on each process before rebalancing, after rebalancing, and after consistency checks.
Initial.     Min: 24, Max: 36, Ratio: 1.500000
Rebalanced.  Min: 30, Max: 30, Ratio: 1.000000
After.      Min: 30, Max: 30, Ratio: 1.000000
