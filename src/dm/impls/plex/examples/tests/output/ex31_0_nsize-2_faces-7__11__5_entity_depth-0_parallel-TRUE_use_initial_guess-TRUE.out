Attempt rebalancing of shared points of depth 0 on interface of mesh distribution.
Size of generated auxiliary graph: 56
Using ParMETIS to partition graph.
Using current distribution of points as initial guess.
Comparing number of owned entities of depth 0 on each process before rebalancing, after rebalancing, and after consistency checks.
Initial.     Min: 258, Max: 318, Ratio: 1.232558
Rebalanced.  Min: 286, Max: 290, Ratio: 1.013986
After.      Min: 286, Max: 290, Ratio: 1.013986
