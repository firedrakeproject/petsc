Attempt rebalancing of shared points of depth 1 on interface of mesh distribution.
Size of generated auxiliary graph: 221
Using ParMETIS to partition graph.
Using current distribution of points as initial guess.
Comparing number of owned entities of depth 1 on each process before rebalancing, after rebalancing, and after consistency checks.
Initial.     Min: 307, Max: 441, Ratio: 1.436482
Rebalanced.  Min: 329, Max: 409, Ratio: 1.243161
After.      Min: 329, Max: 409, Ratio: 1.243161
