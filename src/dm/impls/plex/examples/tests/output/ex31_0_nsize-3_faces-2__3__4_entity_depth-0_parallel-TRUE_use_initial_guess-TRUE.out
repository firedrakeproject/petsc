Attempt rebalancing of shared points of depth 0 on interface of mesh distribution.
Size of generated auxiliary graph: 24
Using ParMETIS to partition graph.
Using current distribution of points as initial guess.
Comparing number of owned entities of depth 0 on each process before rebalancing, after rebalancing, and after consistency checks.
Initial.     Min: 15, Max: 27, Ratio: 1.800000
Rebalanced.  Min: 19, Max: 21, Ratio: 1.105263
After.      Min: 19, Max: 21, Ratio: 1.105263
