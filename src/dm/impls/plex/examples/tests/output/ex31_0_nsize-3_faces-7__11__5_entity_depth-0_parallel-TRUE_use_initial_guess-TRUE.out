Attempt rebalancing of shared points of depth 0 on interface of mesh distribution.
Size of generated auxiliary graph: 105
Using ParMETIS to partition graph.
Using current distribution of points as initial guess.
Comparing number of owned entities of depth 0 on each process before rebalancing, after rebalancing, and after consistency checks.
Initial.     Min: 168, Max: 228, Ratio: 1.357143
Rebalanced.  Min: 187, Max: 201, Ratio: 1.074866
After.      Min: 187, Max: 201, Ratio: 1.074866
