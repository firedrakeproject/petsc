Attempt rebalancing of shared points of depth 1 on interface of mesh distribution.
Size of generated auxiliary graph: 184
Using ParMETIS to partition graph.
Using current distribution of points as initial guess.
Comparing number of owned entities of depth 1 on each process before rebalancing, after rebalancing, and after consistency checks.
Initial.     Min: 458, Max: 563, Ratio: 1.229258
Rebalanced.  Min: 490, Max: 518, Ratio: 1.057143
After.      Min: 490, Max: 518, Ratio: 1.057143
