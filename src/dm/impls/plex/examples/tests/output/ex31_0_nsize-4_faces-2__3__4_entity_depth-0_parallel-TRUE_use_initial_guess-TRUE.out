Attempt rebalancing of shared points of depth 0 on interface of mesh distribution.
Size of generated auxiliary graph: 32
Using ParMETIS to partition graph.
Using current distribution of points as initial guess.
Comparing number of owned entities of depth 0 on each process before rebalancing, after rebalancing, and after consistency checks.
Initial.     Min: 8, Max: 24, Ratio: 3.000000
Rebalanced.  Min: 11, Max: 19, Ratio: 1.727273
After.      Min: 11, Max: 19, Ratio: 1.727273
