Attempt rebalancing of shared points of depth 0 on interface of mesh distribution.
Size of generated auxiliary graph: 125
Using ParMETIS to partition graph.
Using current distribution of points as initial guess.
Comparing number of owned entities of depth 0 on each process before rebalancing, after rebalancing, and after consistency checks.
Initial.     Min: 108, Max: 181, Ratio: 1.675926
Rebalanced.  Min: 119, Max: 163, Ratio: 1.369748
After.      Min: 119, Max: 163, Ratio: 1.369748
