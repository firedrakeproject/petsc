Attempt rebalancing of shared points of depth 1 on interface of mesh distribution.
Size of generated auxiliary graph: 87
Using ParMETIS to partition graph.
Using current distribution of points as initial guess.
Comparing number of owned entities of depth 1 on each process before rebalancing, after rebalancing, and after consistency checks.
Initial.     Min: 45, Max: 93, Ratio: 2.066667
Rebalanced.  Min: 57, Max: 83, Ratio: 1.456140
After.      Min: 57, Max: 83, Ratio: 1.456140
